The remaining eggs are sold at the farmers' market.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of eggs used:\n3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for friends) = 7 eggs\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of eggs left to sell:\n16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs\n\nJanet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each, so her daily earnings are:\n9 eggs * $2/egg = $18\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$\n\nThis answer means that Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
