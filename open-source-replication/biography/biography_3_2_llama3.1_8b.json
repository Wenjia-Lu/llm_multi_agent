He has made significant contributions to the field, including the study of the complexity of functions and the hardness of approximating certain problems.\n\n\u2022 **Achievements**: Rudich is known for his work on the PCP theorem, a fundamental result in complexity theory that establishes a connection between the complexity of problems and the hardness of approximating them. He has also made significant contributions to the study of hardness of approximation and the complexity of approximation problems.\n\n\u2022 **Awards and Honors**: Rudich has received several awards and honors for his contributions to computer science. He was awarded the G\u00f6del Prize in 1998 for his work on the PCP theorem, and he has been elected as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for his outstanding contributions to the field.\n\n\u2022 **Academic Career**: Rudich is currently a Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where he has been teaching and conducting research since 1990. However, it's also mentioned that he is currently a professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, which seems to be incorrect based on other information.\n\n\u2022 **Collaborations and Publications**: Rudich has collaborated with many prominent researchers in the field of computer science, and he has published numerous papers in top-tier conferences and journals. His work has been widely cited and has had a significant impact on the development of complexity theory and cryptography.\n\nI have corrected the biography by combining the information from the other agents' responses. However, there seems to be a discrepancy regarding Rudich's current academic affiliation. Based on other information, it appears that he is a Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University."
